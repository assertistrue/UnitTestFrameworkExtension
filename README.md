# UnitTestFrameworkExtension
C# extension of the existing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting .NET framework

## Source Codes
* All the projects including the test project are built using VS 2015 with Dot NET 4.5
* This not only serves to make my usual unit test code snippet available on the web as I need it, it also
serve as an opportunity for me to test out the GITHUB-VisualStudio extension 

Have fun.
